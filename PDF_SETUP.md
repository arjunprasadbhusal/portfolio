# Resume PDF Download Setup

## Current Implementation ✅

Your portfolio now has fully functional PDF download capabilities:

### 1. **Static PDF Download** (Primary Method)
- All "Download CV" and "Download PDF" buttons now link directly to `resume.pdf`
- File downloads as "Arjun_Bhusal_Resume.pdf" for better naming
- Works immediately without any additional setup

### 2. **Dynamic PDF Generation** (Optional Enhancement)

To enable the "Generate PDF" button that creates a PDF from the current webpage:

#### Option A: Basic PDF Generation
Uncomment these lines in `resume.html` (around line 1447):
```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jspdf/2.5.1/jspdf.umd.min.js"></script>
```

#### Option B: Advanced PDF Generation (Recommended)
Uncomment both lines in `resume.html`:
```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jspdf/2.5.1/jspdf.umd.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/html2canvas/1.4.1/html2canvas.min.js"></script>
```
